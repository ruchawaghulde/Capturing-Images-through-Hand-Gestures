# Capturing Images through Hand Gestures
This project is implemented as an application of Sixth Sense Technology. Inspiration for this project is taken from the project on sixth sense by Pranav Mistry, a Computer Scientist.
 
 ## Sixth Sense Technology
Sixth sense is our ability to perceive the subtledimension or the unseen world. It also includes our ability to understand the subtle cause and effect relationship behind many events, which is beyond the understanding of the intellect. When the sixth sense is developed or activated, it helps us to experience the subtle-world or subtle-dimension. 
Sixth Sense Technology bridges this gap, bringing intangible, digital information out into the tangible world, and allowing us to interact with this information via natural hand gestures. ‘Sixth Sense’ frees information from its confines by seamlessly integrating it with reality, and thus making the entire world your computer. 

## Project Goal
In this project, we have created an algorithm to capture an image from the real world using hand gestures. The working mechanism of the algorithm is very simple. It gathers data from the user’s surroundings, makes query using Raspberry Pi as a data store, processes the query and presents information back to user via a display.  
The software program processes the video stream data captured by the camera using simple computer-vision techniques. Some of the techniques such as background subtraction, back projection, histogram identification, edge detection, gesture recognition etc. are used in this project. 

## Components 
* Camera: Captures an object in view and tracks the user’s hand gestures
* Raspberry Pi: Standalone device
* Computing Device: Computer
